gold_indicators:
  # Gold/Silver Ratio - Measures relative value of gold vs silver
  # Lower ratio = Gold relatively cheap (bullish signal)
  # Higher ratio = Gold relatively expensive (bearish signal)
  # Historical range: 40-95, typical: 55-85
  gold_silver_ratio:
    strong_buy_threshold: 55      # Ratio < 55: Gold very cheap relative to silver
    buy_threshold: 70             # Ratio 55-70: Gold moderately cheap

    strong_sell_threshold: 95     # Ratio > 95: Gold very expensive
    
    interpretation:
      strong_buy: "Gold/Silver ratio < 55 indicates gold is historically cheap relative to silver. Strong buy signal."

      strong_sell: "S&P 500/Gold ratio > 2.5 indicates stocks are historically expensive. Strong buy signal for gold."

  # GVZ (Cboe Gold Volatility Index) - Measures gold market fear/uncertainty
  # Higher GVZ = High fear/uncertainty (contrarian buy signal)
  # Lower GVZ = Low fear/complacency (contrarian sell signal)
  # Historical range: 5-100, typical: 10-50

    sell_threshold: 15            # GVZ 10-15: Low volatility (complacency, sell)
    strong_sell_threshold: 10     # GVZ < 10: Extreme complacency (strong sell)
    
    interpretation:

  # ===== PHASE 2: NEW CRYPTO SENTIMENT INDICATORS =====
  
  # BTC/QQQ Ratio - Measures crypto performance vs tech stocks
  # Distinguishes crypto-specific trends from general tech/risk sentiment
  # Higher ratio = BTC outperforming tech stocks (crypto-specific strength)
  # Lower ratio = BTC underperforming tech stocks (risk-off or crypto weakness)

  btc_qqq_ratio:
    hot_threshold: 0.30           # > 0.30: Crypto-specific strength (bullish)
    normal_min: 0.15              # 0.15-0.30: Normal range
    cold_threshold: 0.15          # < 0.15: Crypto weakness vs tech (bearish)
    
    interpretation:
      hot: "BTC/QQQ ratio > 0.30 indicates crypto outperforming tech stocks. Bullish crypto-specific strength."
      normal: "BTC/QQQ ratio 0.15-0.30 is normal range. Crypto tracking tech sentiment."
      cold: "BTC/QQQ ratio < 0.15 indicates crypto underperforming tech. Risk-off or crypto-specific weakness."
    
    # Scoring contribution:
    # Hot (> 0.30) = -1 (bullish for crypto)
    # Normal (0.15-0.30) = 0 (neutral)
    # Cold (< 0.15) = +1 (bearish for crypto)
  
  # Crypto Fear & Greed Index - Alternative.me sentiment indicator

      neutral: "Crypto F&G 45-55: Neutral sentiment. Hold current position."
      greed: "Crypto F&G 56-75: Greed sentiment. Consider taking profits."
      extreme_greed: "Crypto F&G > 75: Extreme Greed detected. Contrarian strong sell signal - euphoria often precedes correction."
    
    # Scoring contribution (contrarian):
    # Extreme Fear (0-24) = -2 (strong buy)
    # Fear (25-44) = -1 (buy)
    # Neutral (45-55) = 0 (hold)
    # Greed (56-75) = +1 (sell)
    # Extreme Greed (76-100) = +2 (strong sell)

  # ===== PHASE 3: WEIGHTED SCORING SYSTEM =====
  
  # Indicator weights for weighted scoring calculation
  # Each indicator produces -2 to +2 score, multiplied by weight
  # Total weighted score range: -10 to +10
  weights:
    btc_volatility: 0.8       # Technical volatility indicator
    eth_volatility: 0.8       # Technical volatility indicator
    btc_eth_ratio: 0.7        # Relative value (lowest weight - internal crypto metric)
    btc_dominance: 0.9        # Market structure indicator
    btc_qqq_ratio: 1.0        # Balanced weight - crypto vs traditional market
    crypto_fear_greed: 1.2    # Highest weight - direct sentiment measure
    # Total weight sum: 5.4 → Max score: 2 × 5.4 = 10.8, Min score: -2 × 5.4 = -10.8
    # Normalized to -10 to +10 range by weight selection
  
  # Overall scoring system for crypto (UPDATED for Phase 3)
  # Phase 1: 3 indicators (volatility, ratio, dominance) → -3 to +3
  # Phase 2: 5 indicators (adds BTC/QQQ and F&G) → -5 to +5 range
  # Phase 3: 6 indicators with weighted scoring → -10 to +10 range
  # 
  # Scoring methodology:
  # 1. Each indicator produces -2 to +2 score:
  #    - Volatility: High vol (-2, fear/buy) → Low vol (+2, complacency/sell)
  #    - BTC/ETH: Low ratio (-2, BTC cheap) → High ratio (+2, BTC expensive)
  #    - BTC Dom: Low (<35%, -2, altcoin season) → High (>60%, +2, BTC dominance)
  #    - BTC/QQQ: Low (<0.15, -2, crypto weak) → High (>0.30, +2, crypto strong vs tech)
  #    - Fear & Greed: Extreme Fear (0-24, -2, buy) → Extreme Greed (76-100, +2, sell)
  # 2. Apply weights: weighted_score = sum(indicator_score × weight)
  # 3. Map total to recommendation using thresholds below
  #
  # BTC uses: all 6 indicators
  # ETH uses: all 6 indicators (btc_eth_ratio and btc_dominance inverted)
