# Performance Attribution Benchmark Configuration
# This file defines the strategic asset allocation benchmark and market indices
# for performance attribution analysis using the Brinson-Fachler model.

# Strategic Asset Allocation Benchmark
# ============================================================================
# The benchmark represents a strategic asset allocation that serves as the 
# performance comparison baseline. Weights should sum to 1.0 (100%).
